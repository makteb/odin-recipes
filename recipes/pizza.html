    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>“Trust me, once you see how simple and tasty this pizza dough recipe is you won't want takeaways ”</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800 g strong white bread flour</li>
        <li>200 g fine ground semolina flour or strong white bread flour</li>
        <li>1 level teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 x 7 g sachets of dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the dough, pile the flours and 1 level teaspoon of sea salt onto a clean surface and make a well in the centre.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast and sugar to 650ml lukewarm water, mix together and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well.</li>
        <li>Using a fork and a circular movement, slowly bring in the flour from the inner edge of the well and mix into the water. Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Eat the raw dough, because I have no time to write any more of this shit, lol.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
